    <h1>The Invention of the Light Bulb</h1>
</header>

<article>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The light bulb is one of the most important inventions in human history. Its invention revolutionized the way we live and work, providing a safer, cleaner, and more efficient source of light than anything that had come before it. But how did the light bulb come to be?</p>

    <h2>Example:</h2>

    <h2>Early Struggles with Light</h2>
    <p>Before electric light bulbs, people used candles, oil lamps, and gas lamps to light their homes. These sources of light were often inefficient, dangerous, and emitted dim light. The quest for a better form of lighting led to many experiments throughout history.</p>

    <h2>Early Experiments and Discoveries</h2>
    <p>The idea of producing light through electricity was first explored in the early 1800s. A significant contribution came from <strong>Humphry Davy</strong>, an English scientist. In 1800, he demonstrated that electricity could produce light by passing it through a piece of carbon, creating the first electric arc light. This was a crucial step but too harsh for practical use in homes.</p>

    <h2>The Role of Sir Hiram Maxim</h2>
    <p>While <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> is often credited with inventing the modern light bulb, there were others who contributed to its development. One notable figure is <strong>Sir Hiram Maxim</strong>, who created an early form of the incandescent bulb in the late 1870s. Although Maxim's design was not practical or long-lasting, it helped shape future developments.</p>

    <h2>Thomas Edison's Breakthrough</h2>
    <p>Thomas Edison, an American inventor, is perhaps the most famous name associated with the invention of the light bulb. In 1879, after years of experimentation, Edison successfully developed a practical, long-lasting light bulb using a carbon filament. Edison's light bulb became the prototype for future innovations and is often referred to as the "modern" light bulb.</p>

    <h2>The Legacy of the Light Bulb</h2>
    <p>The invention of the light bulb changed the world in countless ways. It extended the hours in which people could work and live. It also opened the door for further innovations in electricity and electronics. Today, the light bulb remains an essential part of our daily lives, constantly evolving with new technologies like LED and energy-efficient bulbs.</p>
